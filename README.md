# Template-Engine-Employee-Summery



 We created a modern CLI that takes in information about employees and generates an HTML webpage that displays information for each employee. I also made sure that it pasts all unit tests.  
  
## Click [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/15jffPtdfOj3spxVYMkrLxlPKhJ8msG7P/view?usp=sharing) for the live app.

This is the prompt to start the application:


 ![Start Screenshot](images/start.png)
 
 The first prompt asks for the managers name:

 the second prompt asks for the managers id:

 the third prompt asks for the mangers email:

 the fourth prompt asks for the managers officenumber:

 The command line then gives the user to select another employee or  end the application:

 The engineer would have the same prompts as the manager except the prompt which asks the the engineers github:

 The intern would have the same prompts as the manager except the propmpt which asks for the interns University

 When the user is finished, the user will get a command whether new html page has been generated or if there is already an existing team html page:

 The users information will then be displayed on an html page:
